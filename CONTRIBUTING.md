# Contributing Guidelines:

1. Anyone can contribute
2. If your problem doesn't fit into one of the existing folders, create a new one. Try not to just dump into the Miscellaneous folder.
3. File format:
  
  In comments at the top of the file:
    
    Problem Name
    
    Problem Description
    
    INPUT:
    
    OUTPUT:
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    
    Sample input:
    
    Sample output:
     
4. Try to explain your code using comments. No point having a good solution if no one can make sense of it.
5. Please don't use spaces in the program name. This may cause some unexpected issues if used via the CLI. Instead, use either CamelCase or use underscore example Zero_One_Knapsack.py.
